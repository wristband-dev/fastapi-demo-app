# Wristband Python FastAPI Accelerator

This repo contains a full-stack application accelerator showcasing Wristband authentication integration with a FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend. This repository provides a production-ready foundation for building secure, multi-tenant web applications with enterprise-grade authentication.

When an unauthenticated user attempts to access the frontend, it will redirect to the FastAPI backend's Login Endpoint, which in turn redirects the user to Wristband to authenticate. Wristband then redirects the user back to your application's Callback Endpoint which sets a session cookie before returning the user's browser to the frontend project.

## Getting Started

You can start up the demo application in a few simple steps.

### 1) Sign up for a Wristband account

First, make sure you sign up for a Wristband account at [https://wristband.dev](https://wristband.dev).

### 2) Provision the FastAPI demo application in the Wristband Dashboard

After your Wristband account is set up, log in to the Wristband dashboard. Once you land on the home page of the dashboard, create a new application:

1. Configure Application Domain Name
2. Add OAuth2 Client:
   - Set platform to "Python"
   - Set callback URL: `https://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback` (for local testing)
3. Create a tenant in Wristband

You can also follow the [Demo App Guide](https://docs.wristband.dev/docs/setting-up-a-demo-app) for more information.

### 3) Apply your Wristband configuration values

After completing application creation, you will need to configure environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the project root by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, add your Wristband configuration values:

```
CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
LOGIN_STATE_SECRET="YOUR_LOGIN_STATE_SECRET"
WRISTBAND_APPLICATION_DOMAIN="YOUR_WRISTBAND_APPLICATION_DOMAIN"
```

### 4) Install dependencies & Activate Python VENV

You can install all required dependencies with a single command:

```bash
npm run setup && source backend/.venv/bin/activate
```

This will set up both the frontend and backend components.

### 5) Run the application

Once everything is set up, you can start the application with:

```bash
npm start

# run in debug mode
npm run start:debug
```

## How to interact with the demo app

### Signup Users

Now that the demo app is up and running, you can sign up your first customer on the Signup Page at the following location:

- `https://{application_vanity_domain}/signup`, where `{application_vanity_domain}` should be replaced with the value of the "Application Vanity Domain" value of the application (found in the Wristband Dashboard).

This signup page is hosted by Wristband. Completing the signup form will provision both a new tenant with the specified tenant domain name and a new user that is assigned to that tenant.

### Application-level Login (Tenant Discovery)

Users of this app can access the Application-level Login Page at the following location:

- `https://{application_vanity_domain}/login`, where `{application_vanity_domain}` should be replaced with the value of the "Application Vanity Domain" value of the application.

This login page is hosted by Wristband. Here, the user will be prompted to enter either their email or their tenant's domain name, redirecting them to the Tenant-level Login Page for their specific tenant.

### Tenant-level Login

If users wish to directly access the Tenant-level Login Page without going through the Application-level Login Page, they can do so at:

- `https://localhost:8080/api/auth/login?tenant_domain={tenant_domain}`, where `{tenant_domain}` should be replaced with the desired tenant's domain name.

This login page is hosted by Wristband. Here, the user will be prompted to enter their credentials to login to the application.

### Architecture

This demo app consists of:

- **FastAPI Backend**: A Python backend with Wristband authentication integration
- **Next.js Frontend**: A modern React-based frontend with authentication context
- **Firestore Database**: For storing application data

The backend handles all authentication flows, including:
- Storing client ID and secret
- Handling OAuth2 authorization code flow redirections
- Managing session cookies
- Token refresh
- API orchestration
